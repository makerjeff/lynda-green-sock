 ###Steps
 
 1. Create 'Outer' container with a hyperlink
 2. Create 'Inner' container to house all elements
 
 
 
 
 
 ###Additional notes
 
 - Use single PNG as a sprite sheet (seemingly instant loading)
 - Compress to PNG-8
 
 
 - ```myAd_Img``` class defines the base style, graphic, and position.
 - each individual element should have their own unique IDs.
